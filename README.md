This is ChatGPT Assistant that will summarize any article you pass into it. It utilizes RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) where generates an ouput for the user, based on the user's question.
I utilized web scraping functionalities within Python - BeautifulSoup and reportlab, which takes any website you pass into the web scraping tool and inputs the content into the pdf.
Then, the pdf is passed into the GPT assistant, using OPEN AI's code interpreter and retrieval tools within the Assistant's API.
